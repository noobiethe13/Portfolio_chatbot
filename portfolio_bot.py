ABOUT, DEBAYAN = `I'm a tech-obsessed full-stack developer with a year of experience building web
and mobile apps. My coding journey began with pure curiosity, sparked by a GitHub page for a Kotlin
video player that left me wondering how this seemingly gibberish could turn into a functional app.
Now, I work with HTML, Tailwind CSS, React for web, and Flutter for cross-platform mobile, along
with native Android using Kotlin and Java. My backend skills include Node.js, Express.js, Firebase,
MongoDB, and AWS. As a lifelong learner, I'm always exploring new tech and contributing to opensource projects. I thrive on creating beautiful, functional apps that drive user engagement and
business growth.`;
